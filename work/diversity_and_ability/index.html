            <p>Diversity and Ability was a social enterprise founded in 2011, operating as a UK limited company pledged to use profits to further its social mission of supporting disabled people. The company provided one-to-one support sessions for disabled students at UK universities and later expanded into disability consultancy services.</p>
<p>I joined as a founding member and quickly established myself as IT Director, a role that encompassed two distinct but complementary responsibilities: infrastructure management and software engineering leadership.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure and Operations</h2>
<p>As IT Director, I was responsible for the complete technical infrastructure supporting the organisation. This included maintaining reliable email systems, ensuring our WordPress website remained operational, and managing hardware provisioning for all staff members. I successfully guided the company through Cyber Essentials Plus accreditation, demonstrating our commitment to robust cybersecurity practices.</p>
<h2>Software Engineering Team Leadership</h2>
<p>For many years, I was the sole software engineer, personally developing internal tools and customer-facing solutions. As the company grew, I built and led a dedicated software engineering team responsible for creating both internal productivity tools and B2C SaaS products. Our key developments included <a href="/work/axs_passport">AXS Passport</a> and <a href="/work/pistachio">Pistachio</a>, which served our expanding client base.</p>
<h2>Data Protection Excellence</h2>
<p>Given the sensitive nature of our data, extensive personal and special category information relating to physical and mental health, I recognised the critical importance of highest standards of data protection practices. I initially qualified as a Data Protection Officer under the previous Data Protection Act, ensuring compliance from the earliest stages of the company&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>With the introduction of GDPR, I recruited and built a specialist data protection team to handle the increased regulatory requirements. Whilst GDPR prevented me from continuing as DPO due to my director role, I continued to lead this team, maintaining our gold-standard compliance approach. This proactive stance on data protection was essential given the highly sensitive nature of the personal data we processed.</p>
