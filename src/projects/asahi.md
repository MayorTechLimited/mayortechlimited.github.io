title: Asahi

I helped build the Asahi Super Dry website using Python and Wagtail. This is a
marketing/blog site ran by many teams across the world. I built a flexible
translation system (internationalisation, i18n) for them, as well as custom CRM
widgets to help them easily create competitions. These competitions have seen
tens of thousands of entries.
