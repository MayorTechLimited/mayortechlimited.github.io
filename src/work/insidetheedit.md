I provided comprehensive technical leadership and development services for Inside the
Edit's Django-based subscription platform over nearly 8 years, supporting thousands of
users and processing hundreds of thousands of pounds in revenue.

I began working with Inside the Edit when they faced an urgent crisis: Stripe was
discontinuing an old API that their payment system relied upon. Rather than implementing
a quick fix, I spent the first week retroactively adding comprehensive test coverage to
the existing codebase. This methodical approach ensured that when I updated the Stripe
integration, all functionality remained stable and reliable. The migration was completed
successfully without any service interruption.

I continued to work with Inside the Edit and delivered many additional features.

I completely rebuilt their video delivery infrastructure to handle significantly higher
concurrent traffic loads whilst implementing robust anti-piracy measures. Key
improvements included:

- Domain restriction controls to prevent unauthorised video embedding
- Automated monitoring systems to detect suspicious account activity patterns
- Alert systems for unusual viewing behaviours such as consecutive video consumption
- Enhanced security protocols to protect premium content

I extended the Stripe integration beyond subscriptions to support diverse revenue
streams:

- One-off payments for short online courses
- Merchandise sales with dynamic shipping fee calculation
- Integration with multiple third-party delivery and inventory management systems
- Implementation of Stripe's tax calculation features, including complex VAT MOSS
  compliance for EU-registered companies

I developed a comprehensive live streaming solution that enabled monetised broadcasts:

- Real-time video streaming infrastructure for paid events
- Interactive Q&A system allowing audience participation
- Payment processing for live event access
- Embedded broadcasting capabilities

I implemented a flexible voucher and coupon code system, enabling the business to offer
targeted discounts on subscriptions and drive customer acquisition through promotional
campaigns.
