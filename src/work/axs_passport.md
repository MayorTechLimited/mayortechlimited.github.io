AXS Passport is a digital tool for sharing accessibility and inclusion
requirements in order to create a more equitable society. I helped build the web
app (JS, SvelteKit) and API (Python, FastAPI), and run the servers. I ran the
team building this product including designers, front-end devs, back-end devs,
mobile devs, and others.
