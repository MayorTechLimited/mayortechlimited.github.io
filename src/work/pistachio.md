A Flask-based bespoke CRM system I built to handle the complex paperwork and admin
requirements of public sector funding. Over the years it expanded to support automated
invoicing, calendar scheduling, customer dashboards, and more. It has been used to
support more than 40,000 customers and 350,000 hours of one-to-one support.
