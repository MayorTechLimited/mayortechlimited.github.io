title: Diversity and Ability
description: From the early days of this social enterprise I established myself as IT Director, building and leading multiple technical teams whilst ensuring enterprise-grade security and compliance.

Diversity and Ability was a social enterprise founded in 2011, operating as a UK limited company pledged to use profits to further its social mission of supporting disabled people. The company provided one-to-one support sessions for disabled students at UK universities and later expanded into disability consultancy services.

I joined as a founding member and quickly established myself as IT Director, a role that encompassed two distinct but complementary responsibilities: infrastructure management and software engineering leadership.

## Infrastructure and Operations

As IT Director, I was responsible for the complete technical infrastructure supporting the organisation. This included maintaining reliable email systems, ensuring our WordPress website remained operational, and managing hardware provisioning for all staff members. I successfully guided the company through Cyber Essentials Plus accreditation, demonstrating our commitment to robust cybersecurity practices.

## Software Engineering Team Leadership

For many years, I was the sole software engineer, personally developing internal tools and customer-facing solutions. As the company grew, I built and led a dedicated software engineering team responsible for creating both internal productivity tools and B2C SaaS products. Our key developments included [AXS Passport](/work/axs_passport) and [Pistachio](/work/pistachio), which served our expanding client base.

## Data Protection Excellence

Given the sensitive nature of our data, extensive personal and special category information relating to physical and mental health, I recognised the critical importance of highest standards of data protection practices. I initially qualified as a Data Protection Officer under the previous Data Protection Act, ensuring compliance from the earliest stages of the company's growth.

With the introduction of GDPR, I recruited and built a specialist data protection team to handle the increased regulatory requirements. Whilst GDPR prevented me from continuing as DPO due to my director role, I continued to lead this team, maintaining our gold-standard compliance approach. This proactive stance on data protection was essential given the highly sensitive nature of the personal data we processed.
