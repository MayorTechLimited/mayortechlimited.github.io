    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p>
        Here's a list of projects and clients that Mayor Tech Limited have
        worked with.
    </p>
</div>
<section>
    <h2 class="mb-0">Asahi</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://asahisuperdry.com">https://asahisuperdry.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We helped build the Asahi Super Dry website. This is a marketing/blog
        site ran by many teams across the world. We built a flexible translation
        system (internationalisation, i18n) for them, as well as processes for
        easily adding and managing new brands/themes as new marketing material
        is generated.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">AXS Passport</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://axs-passport.co">https://axs-passport.co</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        AXS passport is a digital tool for sharing accessibility and inclusion
        requirements in order to create a more equitable society. We built the
        web app and API, and run the servers.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">BAFTA</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://baftaelectron.com">https://baftaelectron.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We worked on a product called “Source2Screen” (now called “BAFTA
        Electron“). It had started as an in-house tool for managing large
        volumes of media, used for the BAFTA awards nominations. We helped to
        build an application that turned the in-house tool into a
        software-as-a-service (SAAS) product.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">Diversity and Ability</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://diversityandability.com"
            >https://diversityandability.com</a
        >
    </p>
    <p>
        We run their internal IT systems (email, collaborative documents,
        business intelligence tools, etc. etc.). We also build their internal
        information security management system (ISMS).
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">Inside the Edit</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://insidetheedit.com">https://insidetheedit.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We extended their existing website; adding subscription payment
        processing, live-streaming events, HD video storage/streaming, and many
        other features. We also migrated their hosting provider in order to save
        hosting costs and reduce downtime.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">MenuWizard</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://menuwizard.com">https://menuwizard.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        An app that helps people find restaurants and meals that are suitable
        for their dietry requirements. We build the API that powers the app, and
        we manage the servers and hosting.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">PickTeamz</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://pickteamz.com">https://pickteamz.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We brought the ideas and passion of the founder to life; a new-style
        fantasy football game. As well as playing the game via the website, we
        also built an iOS and Android app.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">RFGraph</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://rfgraph.com">https://rfgraph.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We built a single page app (SPA) and back-end API that enables complex
        hardware simulations. As well as a feature-rich front-end application we
        also built payment processing, and created the marketing and customer
        support sites.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">SleepyMap</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://sleepymap.com">https://sleepymap.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        An internal project that we built to meet a gap in the market; a simple
        way to turn a spreadsheet into a map.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">SoftIron</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://softiron.com">https://softiron.com</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        We help them build various internal tools. Some for supporting their
        manufacturing; serial number generation, MAC address assignments, and
        lots more. Other projects included marketing tools (static asset
        management and hosting), and hardware cluster management (APIs for
        adding removing servers to a CEPH cluster).
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">UDISAS</h2>
    <p class="mt-0"><a href="https://udisas.com">https://udisas.com</a></p>
    <p>
        An online assessment tool that can help a person to identify the
        barriers they are facing and possible solutions. We build the website
        and manage the servers and hosting.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-0">vantage</h2>
    <p class="mt-0">
        <a href="https://vantage-org.github.io/vantage"
            >https://vantage-org.github.io/vantage</a
        >
    </p>
    <p>
        A task runner that integrates nicely with Docker and that has great
        support for managing environment variables. We use it in almost all of
        our projects.
