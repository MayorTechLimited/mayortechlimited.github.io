Can you help with writing up a web page (in markdown) on a project that William worked
on. The page needs to describe the work he did in a professional manner, showcasing the
skills and talents that he has. Similar to a CV in tone. Make William sound competent,
professional, friendly, and highly skilled.

Write several paragraphs of detail oriented prose about the project and the technical
skills used to build it.

Also write a short 2-3 sentence summary that can be used as the page description, and
copied into the CV as a project summary.
