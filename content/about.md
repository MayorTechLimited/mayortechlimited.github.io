## The Mayor Tech Story

Mayor Tech work with a range of businesses to provide the software support that they need. 

Some of our clients are small companies, like [Inside the Edit](https://insidetheedit.com), where we are responsible for building and maintaining payment processing, video streaming, behind the scenes admin processes/reports, and subscription-based access controls. 

Others are large multi-national companies, like [SoftIron](https://softiron.com), where we help build complex APIs that support internal manufacturing and marketing processes. 

To get a real feel for the type of work we do, read about our past clients and projects on our [projects list](/projects/).

## Our Ethos

We build high quality software, we don't cut corners, and we don't rush. We work closely with our clients, often over many years, making sure that what we make is exactly what they needed.

Technologies are tools to be used in the right context. We are not wedded to any particular way of doings things, or any particular frameworks/libraries. We choose the right tool for the job.

We want to leave the world in a better state than we found it. We want to work with people/companies that are doing good things. We will not work with people/companies doing bad things.
