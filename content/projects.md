## Clients

Here are a selection of our main clients over the years, and brief descriptions of the work we did with them.

### BAFTA

We worked on a product called “Source2Screen” (now called “BAFTA Electron“). It had started as an in-house tool for managing large volumes of media, used for the BAFTA awards nominations. We helped to build an application that turned the in-house tool into a software-as-a-service (SAAS) product.

### Inside the Edit

### Asahi

We helped build the Asahi Super Dry website. This is a marketing/blog site ran by many teams across the world. We built a flexible translation system (internationalisation, i18n) for them, as well as processes for easily adding and managing new brands/themes as new marketing material is generated.

### PickTeamz
