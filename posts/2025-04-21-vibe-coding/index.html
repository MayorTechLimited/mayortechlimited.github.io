<p>I built a mobile app (a game) using AI tools as much as possible. This is my write up
about my experience. I used Gemini 2.5.</p>
<h2>Context, caveats, and considerations</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m mostly a Python developer focused on building websites, I do a fair amount of
JavaScript development, and I do very little mobile app development. I would say that
I&rsquo;m proficient in JS, and that I know enough about mobile app dev to be dangerous. I
think this made building a mobile app a good candidate for testing out AI &ldquo;vibe coding&rdquo;
because I didn&rsquo;t immediately know the answers to problems I encountered. Where I would
usually reach for Google or Stack Overflow, I instead tried to use AI.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to refer to the AI agents that I used for this experiment with &ldquo;it/its&rdquo;
pronouns. AI agents are not people and they are nowhere near having anything approaching
consciousness.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using the Cursor IDE to talk to the AI and have it write code for me. I&rsquo;m using the
free plan with the Pro tier trial expired, so everything I did was at no additional cost
to me.</p>
<h2>The outcome</h2>
<p>It built a good MVP I think. It was fun to build and there were a good number of times
that the AI helped me fix a bug, or dramatically sped up my development speed.</p>
<p>I will continue to use AI to help me code. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll continue to use Cursor,
I&rsquo;ll switch back to Zed (which also has good AI integrations). I don&rsquo;t think that LLMs
are ready to completely code non-trivial projects so using an editor/IDE that is so
focused on having the AI do everything is counter-productive. When you ask the AI to do
something in Cursor it will happily re-write loads of files and then ask you to approve
or reject those changes &ldquo;in place&rdquo;, Git merge style. When the AI gets confused, or
insists on a certain way of doing things, you end up rejecting lots of code and trying
to piece together the good bits. Zed&rsquo;s approach seems right for me; ask for a snippet or
two, and then copy and paste the good bits into your code. Much more like I&rsquo;d approach
finding a solution the old fashioned way.</p>
<p>Possibly someday LLMs will be good enough to build large codebases, maybe this will be
sooner than I think, I&rsquo;m open to that idea. But I wonder if that&rsquo;s a reasonable
end-goal? If we have AI capable of building anything we like, why would we make it write
code in languages created for humans? Why would it use React Native? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be
better to use some kind of &ldquo;machine code&rdquo;? Have the machine talk directly to other
machines. The answer right now is that LLMs can only write code when it&rsquo;s seen lots and
lots of examples of that language before. So it&rsquo;s better at writing JavaScript than it
is Racket, and I doubt it could write a web server or iOS app in assembly. But doesn&rsquo;t
that seem messy and inefficient? Why have the AI write in code that a human <em>could</em> read
and change, but never will?</p>
<p>Are we seeing the end of language development? If languages need a groundswell of
example code before they can be used, and that example code has to be written by humans,
then will we ever see a Python 4? Or a complete newcomer?</p>
<h2>Escapades, and learnings</h2>
<h3>Svelte vs React</h3>
<p>Being picky about the tech stack doesn&rsquo;t work, unless you pick incredibly well known
things. I wanted to use Svelte and I&rsquo;d heard about Svelte Native, I thought this might
be a good opportunity to try it out. It completely failed, it couldn&rsquo;t even install the
dependencies without running into conflicting peers. I hand-edited the code a bit, and
manually tweaked some dependency versions, but it didn&rsquo;t work and it wasn&rsquo;t immediately
obvious to me how to fix it.</p>
<p>This highlights to me that vibe coding takes so much out of the hands of the developer
that fixing issues becomes hard because you don&rsquo;t know the context of your code any
more. Of course this isn&rsquo;t an issue if the AI can peer in and fix things, but as I
learned, it can&rsquo;t just yet. Maybe in the future it will be able to do this.</p>
<p>Second attempt, I didn&rsquo;t specify the tech stack, I just said what I wanted to build. It
picked some rock solid, dependable technologies (ReactNative and Firebase) and built
something that worked first time. Much more impressive. It even left a list at the end
of the things that it hadn&rsquo;t done and said that it could help me with them. Getting the
various Google accounts created and config files set up took much more time than the app
build.</p>
<h3>Wild replacements</h3>
<p>The AI often replaces a file, or lines in a file, sometimes with identical content,
sometimes with slightly different content, e.g. a createdAt field becomes a createdOn
field, or a &ldquo;live&rdquo; status becomes an &ldquo;in_progress&rdquo; status.</p>
<p>I found some cursor rules that would enforce some nice coding styles and approaches, so
I installed those and asked cursor to review one of the files using the new rules. It
happily changed things, I wasn&rsquo;t completely satisfied so we had a back and forth about
the changes until things started to look pretty good. Unfortunately the app was
completely broken at this point. It just loaded to a white screen, no error messages
just a blank screen. The AI couldn&rsquo;t help, it just kept trying to add error borders
around components (that weren&rsquo;t rendering) or console.log statements that never ran. In
the end the solution was good ol&rsquo; fashioned searching for blog posts and StackOverflow
answers.</p>
<h3>New API and bad docs</h3>
<p>I needed to use the Sportmonks API v3 to fetch live data about football matches. The
documentation for this API is patchy in places and hard to understand. I don&rsquo;t think
there are too many examples of the v3 API being used. This means the AI is terrible at
writing code against it. Lots of my time was spent re-writing from scratch the attempts
that it made to talk to the API. It would write a type declaration for what it thought
the data would look like, and be completely wrong, but because I didn&rsquo;t write the type,
finding, diagnosing, and fixing bugs was harder because I had to read and fully
understand everything that the AI had written. If I&rsquo;d have written everything myself
then I would have that context in my head already. In these cases I felt like the AI
slowed me down, or at least took the fun out of programming (it did all the building,
leaving me with all the bugs).</p></div>
