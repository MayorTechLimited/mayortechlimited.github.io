<p>Recently I&rsquo;ve upgraded one of my side-projects to be an actual website that actual people can pay money for. I started to tell people about it to see if I could get any customers. That didn&rsquo;t go too well, I couldn&rsquo;t get a single person to sign up, not even my friends, family, and fools.</p>
<p>So the next step was to ask why? What was wrong? Bad home page? Complicated instructions? Ugly design? It was this part that was terrifying.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a freelance developer, I&rsquo;ve worked for lots of clients, and I&rsquo;ve always welcomed feedback. Your work can only get better if people tell you where you&rsquo;ve gone wrong and where you could do better. There&rsquo;s sometimes a bit of trepidation if you go out on a limb and you&rsquo;re not sure what the reception will be like. At the end of they day though, it&rsquo;s not scary, disappointment might be the strongest negative emotion I&rsquo;ve experienced (w.r.t. feedback) in my regular day job.</p>
<p>This time though? This time was awful.</p>
<p>I want to say that I&rsquo;m very grateful for the feedback I got. I mean it when I say that I welcome feedback, I really do think it makes my work better. The people that took the time to talk to me and tell me what they didn&rsquo;t like, I love those people. They took that time and helped me improve the product.</p>
<p>But when I read the things they said, even if it was only mildly critical, my heart started beating and I felt very panicky. On an emotional level I didn&rsquo;t want to hear bad things.</p>
<p>Why is this? My job and income aren&rsquo;t in the balance here, I&rsquo;d be happy if I broke even. Nobody was cruel, or angry. The critical feedback was all relevant, useful, and I agreed with most of it. So what&rsquo;s with this reaction?</p>
<p>I think it comes down to being more vulnerable because you&rsquo;re not working as part of a whole, you are the whole. Your neck is exposed in ways that it isn&rsquo;t during a client meeting or daily stand up. Negative feedback comes with the message &ldquo;you messed up here&rdquo;, and if you mess up, the whole thing is going to crumble around you. It also says &ldquo;your idea is bad&rdquo;, but you love that idea.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s nonsense of course, negative feedback shows you your weakest points, your strongest are still there and still going strong. You take the feedback and you use it to improve.</p>
<p>You just might have to take a short walk to calm your nerves first.</p></div>
